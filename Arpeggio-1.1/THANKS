Arpeggio is implemented using or influenced by the following free tehnologies:
 - Python Programming Language (http://www.python.org)
 - PyPEG v1.x (http://fdik.org/pyPEG/) and pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) for ideas and inspiration.    

Although not directly related to Arpeggio I wish also to thank to the 
following free software projects that makes the development of Arpeggio (and some other 
projects I am working on) easier and more fun:

- Arch Linux (http://www.archlinux.org/) - Fantastic Linux distro for sw development
- Vim editor (http://www.vim.org/) - The power tool for everyone!
- Git (http://git-scm.com/) - Distributed version control system

... and many more
